# ml_playground Developer Guidelines

**Audience**: Advanced contributors working exclusively on the `ml_playground` module. These rules are binding. Follow them exactly.

## Quick Start

Get up and running immediately:

```bash
uv venv --clear
uv sync --all-groups
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .
uv run pyright && uv run mypy ml_playground
uv run pytest -n auto -W error --strict-markers --strict-config -v
```

## Documentation Structure

This guideline system is organized into focused documents for easy navigation:

### üìã [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) - Environment Setup
- Prerequisites and installation
- Virtual environment creation
- Basic workflow commands
- Configuration system overview
- Quick troubleshooting

### üîß [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) - Core Development Practices
- Quality gates and commit standards
- Testing workflow and organization
- Code style standards and tooling
- Architecture notes and best practices

### üì¶ [IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md](IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md) - Import Standards
- Strict import policies and rationale
- Canonical patterns and examples
- Review checklist and enforcement

### üîç [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Problem Solving
- Common environment issues
- Import and dependency problems
- Platform-specific solutions
- Development workflow fixes

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

**UV-Only Workflow**: Use UV for everything - virtualenv, dependency sync, running tools and tests. No pip, requirements.txt, or manual venv activation.

**Quality First**: All quality gates must pass before any commit/PR:
- Linting and formatting
- Static analysis 
- Type checking
- Tests with warnings as errors

**Granular Commits**: Make small, focused commits with conventional commit messages. Run quality gates before each commit, not just before PR.

**TOML Configuration**: TOML is the primary source of truth, mapped to dataclasses. No ad‚Äëhoc CLI parameter overrides.
- Allowed exceptions (as implemented):
  - Global CLI option `--exp-config PATH` selects an alternative experiment TOML file (replaces the experiment‚Äôs `config.toml`). The global `experiments/default_config.toml` is still merged first under the experiment config.
  - Environment JSON overrides are supported, deep-merged, and strictly re-validated; invalid overrides are ignored to avoid breaking flows:
    - `ML_PLAYGROUND_TRAIN_OVERRIDES`
    - `ML_PLAYGROUND_SAMPLE_OVERRIDES`

**Strict Typing**: Code is strictly typed with explicit types and pathlib.Path for filesystem paths.

## Essential Commands

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
uv venv --clear && uv sync --all-groups
```

**Quality Gates** (run before each commit):
```bash
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .
uv run pyright
uv run mypy ml_playground  
uv run pytest -n auto -W error --strict-markers --strict-config -v
```

**Runtime Entry Points**:
```bash
# Prepare datasets
uv run python -m ml_playground.cli prepare shakespeare
uv run python -m ml_playground.cli prepare bundestag_char

# Train (select config with --exp-config if not using the experiment's default)
uv run python -m ml_playground.cli train shakespeare --exp-config ml_playground/configs/shakespeare_cpu.toml

# Sample from trained model
uv run python -m ml_playground.cli sample shakespeare --exp-config ml_playground/configs/shakespeare_cpu.toml

# End-to-end pipeline
uv run python -m ml_playground.cli loop bundestag_char --exp-config ml_playground/configs/bundestag_char_cpu.toml
```

## Need Help?

- **Setup issues**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for installation and basic workflow
- **Development questions**: Check [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for practices and standards  
- **Import problems**: Review [IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md](IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md) for strict policies
- **Troubleshooting**: Consult [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues
